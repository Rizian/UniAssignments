CS Assignment 1

1. c; because (7+23) isn't a string it will first run the addition operator and then return the value which is 30.
2. only a and c; Variable names may start with an underscore but not numbers, hyphens aren't allowed and both ! and . are operators and will mess up syntax.
3. a, c, d and g
4. c; because they are sequential and not simultaneous operations, x gets overwritten by the value of y changing it to 10 before y gets overwritten by x (which has been changed to 10) and thus y remains as 10 as well.
5. True
6. True
7. c; python follows the mathematical order of operations meaning that 6%7 goes first which results in 6 which then gets added to 5, getting 11 as the result.
8. b
9. b
10. 0.0
11. 0.5
12. 3
13. 7
14. 7
15. 2
16. 8
17. b = 2, c = 2.0, d = 1, e = 1.0, f = 2.5, g = 1.5
18. b
19. a
20. d; this produces an error because you can't do divide operators on a str
21. b
22. False
23. True
24. False
25. True
26. False
27. False
28. x = 3, y = 1
29. d; The answer is an int because there were no floats in the operation and the result is a whole number
30. a; because the floor division only returns whole numbers
